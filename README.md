# Console Application - Collections

## Philâ€™s Lending Library

Lab08-Collections

## Description

This is a C# console application that allows users to borrow and return books from a library. The lending library is a generic collection, and Book is a separate class that holds all the relevant properties and behaviors. 

Through a user interface, users are able to add and remove items from the newly created library and place them into another generic collection, to prove the movement of the individual objects.
